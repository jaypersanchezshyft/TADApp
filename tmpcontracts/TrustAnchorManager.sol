// ** TrustAnchorReference.sol ** //
// 2018 Shyft. all rights reserved.
// Author Chris Forrester

// context:
// TrustAnchorReference is the basic building block for the trust anchor referencing in the logical kyc caching within the Shyft blockchain.
// This generally relates to a series of map reductions and lists, however in this case we're doing an O(n) lookup within a technically massive
// address space. So to return the proper data we simply do a series of hash comparisons, one per lookup field, and see if a value within this
// space is nonzero, thus indicating a membership class. Further requirements for queries can utilize this format for lookups.

// Admins of this contract are able to be set in order to allow for better management practices.
// Bounties are set on http://www.shyft.network/bounties/TrustAnchorReference.sol for any glitches. Please do literally all the work and send a
// pull request with your divine salvation. #<3s


// patterns used:
// owner pattern.
// administrator pattern.

// irregular usages:
//
// (1) structure:
// hash table based mirrored data accessors for maximum read with a bit of write overhead.
// (1) rationale:
// most contracts depend on this and keeping two hash tables in memory constantly when > 90% of transactions should eventually be using the kyc
// database to at least trigger friendly events re: reputation token is a useful thing.

// compatibility:
// fully ethereum EVM compliant.

// future work:
// research into cost/benefit of upgradability.
// further caching and improvement of read performance/cost.

//@note:@todo:@next: add multisig to the onboard/approve/demotions?
