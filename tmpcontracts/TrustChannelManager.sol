//The Trust Channel Manager is an interface for Trust Anchors to collaborate and share directed
//financial communications channels in as closee to a friction free way as possible.
//
//Trust Anchors sign up to collaborate on the Trust Channel, assigning rules that must be in place
//to allow for the interface to function. Verifiability of documentation is a key differentiating
//factor from other identity solutions.
//
//Technically, the Trust Channel contract acts as a service-interface aggregator, relying heavily
//on bit-field manipulation to associate the DCG (directed cyclic graph) relations of the
//participating trust anchor efficiently.
//
//This creates bounds on logic, as lookup tables increase linearly. Bloom filters could theoretically
//be utilized to allow a probablistic pathing that might need to have heavier lookups in the future.


//@note:@todo:@next: examine the use of a de-facto "global id type" section, with Shyft running the
// attestor component via reading certificate-equivalents from signed messages having a valid
// certificate from some third-party entity.
//
// second forms of identity may be used and collected like PGP methods.
